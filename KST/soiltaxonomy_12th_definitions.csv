"0.123","This publication, Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014, coincides with the 20th",0,NA
"0.124","World Congress of Soil Science, to be held on Jeju Island, Korea in June 2014. The Keys",0,NA
"0.125","to Soil Taxonomy serves two purposes. It provides the taxonomic keys necessary for the",0,NA
"0.126","classification of soils in a form that can be used easily in the field. It also acquaints users of",0,NA
"0.127","soil taxonomy with recent changes in the classification system. The twelfth edition of the",0,NA
"0.128","Keys to Soil Taxonomy incorporates all changes approved since the publication in 1999 of",0,NA
"0.129","the second edition of Soil Taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and",0,NA
"0.130","Interpreting Soil Surveys.",0,NA
"0.131","The authors of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy are identified as the “Soil Survey Staff.” This",0,NA
"0.132","term is meant to include all of the soil classifiers in the National Cooperative Soil Survey",0,NA
"0.133","program and in the international community who have made significant contributions to the",0,NA
"0.134","improvement of the taxonomic system. The authors plan to continue issuing updated editions",0,NA
"0.135","of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy as changes warrant new editions.",0,NA
"0.136","One change in this edition is recognizing the occurrence of anhydrite (CaSO4",0,NA
"0.137",") in soils",0,NA
"0.138","with the addition of a new diagnostic horizon, a new mineralogy class, and new Anhydritic",0,NA
"0.139","subgroups for use in soil survey. These are significant improvements to soil taxonomy",0,NA
"0.140","which resulted from international collaboration with soil scientists of the United Arab",0,NA
"0.141","Emirates, where the soils with anhydrite were discovered. Pedologists in Argentina have",0,NA
"0.142","also contributed to this edition with amendments to improve classification of the Mollisols",0,NA
"0.143","of the Pampean region and to recognize the abrupt textural change in more soils having this",0,NA
"0.144","important genetic characteristic.",0,NA
"0.145","Another major change is the incorporation of many of the final recommendations of",0,NA
"0.146","the International Committee on Anthropogenic Soils (ICOMANTH). This international",0,NA
"0.147","committee began in 1995 under the chairmanship of Dr. Ray Bryant and has continued",0,NA
"0.148","under Dr. John Galbraith of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Some of",0,NA
"0.149","the recommendations of ICOMANTH broadly expand the use of geomorphic positions as",0,NA
"0.150","taxonomic criteria for soils which occur on artificial (i.e., anthropogenic) landforms and",0,NA
"0.151","microfeatures. One of the attributes of soil taxonomy states that the differentiae selected",0,NA
"0.152","for classification are soil properties. Characteristics of a site, such as geomorphic position,",0,NA
"0.153","are not used as criteria for classifying natural, undisturbed soils. Geomorphic position had",0,NA
"0.154","previously been used only in the required characteristics of the plaggen epipedon; now,",0,NA
"0.155","its appropriateness for classifying other human-altered and human-transported soils is",0,NA
"0.156","being tested. In addition, the definition of the anthropic epipedon has been expanded and",0,NA
"0.157","simplified, two major materials have been defined, higher taxa have been consolidated at",0,NA
"0.158","the subgroup category under seven defined extragrades, and a new family category class has",0,NA
"0.159","been introduced to convey information on the safety and origin of human-altered and human-",0,NA
"0.160","transported material. Dr. Galbraith’s diligent efforts chairing ICOMANTH have yielded",0,NA
"0.161","amendments which have improved the morphologic description and taxonomic classification",0,NA
"0.162","of human-altered and human-transported soils as well as the recognition of anthropogenic",0,NA

"0.164","Since it was first published 39 years ago, Soil Taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil",0,NA

"1.181","The word “soil,” like many common words, has several",1,1
"1.182","meanings. In its traditional meaning, soil is the natural medium",1,1
"1.183","for the growth of land plants, whether or not it has discernible",1,1
"1.184","soil horizons. This meaning is still the common understanding",1,1
"1.185","of the word, and the greatest interest in soil is centered on this",1,1
"1.186","meaning. People consider soil important because it supports",1,1
"1.187","plants that supply food, fibers, drugs, and other wants of",1,1
"1.188","humans and because it filters water and recycles wastes. Soil",1,1
"1.189","covers the earth’s surface as a continuum, except on bare rock,",1,1
"1.190","in areas of perpetual frost, in deep water, or on the barren ice of",1,1
"1.191","glaciers. In this sense, soil has a thickness that is determined by",1,1
"1.192","the rooting depth of plants.",1,1
"1.193","Soil in this text is a natural body comprised of solids",1,1
"1.194","(minerals and organic matter), liquid, and gases that occurs",1,1
"1.195","on the land surface, occupies space, and is characterized by",1,1
"1.196","one or both of the following: horizons, or layers, that are",1,1
"1.197","distinguishable from the initial material as a result of additions,",1,1
"1.198","losses, transfers, and transformations of energy and matter or",1,1
"1.199","the ability to support rooted plants in a natural environment",1,1
"1.200","(Soil Survey Staff, 1999). This definition is expanded from the",1,1
"1.201","previous version of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1975) to",1,1
"1.202","include soils in areas of Antarctica where pedogenesis occurs",1,1
"1.203","but where the climate is too harsh to support the higher plant",1,1
"1.204","forms.",1,1
"1.205","The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and",1,1
"1.206","either air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that",1,1
"1.207","have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have",1,1
"1.208","soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep",1,1
"1.209","(typically more than about 2.5 m) for the growth of rooted",1,1
"1.210","plants. The horizontal boundaries of soil are areas where the soil",1,1
"1.211","grades to deep water, barren areas, rock, or ice. In some places",1,1
"1.212","the separation between soil and nonsoil is so gradual that clear",1,1
"1.213","distinctions cannot be made.",1,1
"1.214","The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil",1,1
"1.215","underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of the",1,1
"1.216","horizons near the earth’s surface that, in contrast to the",1,1
"1.217","underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions",1,1
"1.218","of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly,",1,1
"1.219","soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy",1,1
"1.220","materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks",1,1
"1.221","of biological activity. The lowest depth of biological activity,",1,1
"1.222","however, is difficult to discern and is often gradual. For",1,1
"1.223","the practicality of soil survey, the lower boundary of soil is",1,1
"1.224","arbitrarily set at 200 cm. In soils where either biological activity",1,1
"1.225","or current pedogenic processes extend to depths greater than",1,1
"1.226","200 cm, the lower limit of the soil for classification purposes",1,1
"1.227","is still 200 cm. In some instances the more weakly cemented",1,1
"1.228","bedrocks (paralithic materials, defined later) and noncemented",1,1
"1.229","bedrocks (some densic materials, defined later) have been",1,1
"1.230","described below the lower boundary of soil and used to",1,1
"1.231","differentiate soil series (series control section, defined in chapter",1,1
"1.232","17). This is permissible even though the paralithic materials",1,1
"1.233","below a paralithic contact are not considered soil in the true",1,1
"1.234","sense. In areas where soil has thin, pedogenically cemented",1,1
"1.235","horizons that are impermeable to roots, the soil extends as",1,1
"1.236","deep as the deepest cemented horizon, but not below 200 cm.",1,1
"1.237","For certain management goals, layers deeper than the lower",1,1
"1.238","boundary of the soil that is classified (200 cm) must also be",1,1
"1.239","described if they affect the content and movement of water and",1,1
"1.240","air or other interpretative concerns.",1,1
"1.241","In the humid tropics, earthy materials may extend to a depth",1,1
"1.242","of many meters with no obvious changes below the upper 1 or",1,1
"1.243","2 m, except for an occasional stone line. In many wet soils,",1,1
"1.244","gleyed soil material may begin a few centimeters below the",1,1
"1.245","surface and, in some areas, continue down for several meters",1,1
"1.246","apparently unchanged with increasing depth. The latter",1,1
"1.247","condition can arise through the gradual filling of a wet basin",1,1
"1.248","in which the A horizon is gradually added to the surface and",1,1
"1.249","becomes gleyed beneath. Finally, the A horizon rests on a thick",1,1
"1.250","mass of gleyed material that may be relatively uniform. In both",1,1
"1.251","of these situations, there is no alternative but to set the lower",1,1
"1.252","limit of soil at the arbitrary limit of 200 cm.",1,1
"1.253","Soil, as defined in this text, does not need to have discernible",1,1
"1.254","genetic horizons, although the presence or absence of genetic",1,1
"1.255","horizons and their nature are of extreme importance in soil",1,1
"1.256","classification. Plants can be grown under glass in pots filled",1,1
"1.257","with earthy materials, such as peat or sand, or even in water.",1,1
"1.258","Under proper conditions all these media are productive for",1,1
"1.259","plants, but they are nonsoil here in the sense that they cannot",1,1
"1.260","be classified in the same system that is used for the soils of a",1,1
"1.261","survey area, county, or even nation. Plants even grow on trees",1,1
"1.262","or in cracks of exposed bedrock (i.e., rock outcrop), but trees",1,1
"1.263","and rock outcrop are regarded as nonsoil.",1,1
"1.264","Soil has many temporal properties that fluctuate hourly,",1,1
"1.265","daily, and seasonally. It may be alternately cold, warm, dry,",1,1
"1.266","or moist. Biological activity is slowed or stopped if the soil",1,1
"1.267","becomes too cold or too dry. The soil receives additions of",1,1
"1.268","fresh, undecomposed organic matter when leaves fall or grasses",1,1
"1.269","die. Soil is not static. The pH, soluble salts, amount of organic",1,1
"1.270","matter and carbon-nitrogen ratio, numbers of microorganisms,",1,1
"1.271","The Soils That We Classify",1,1
"1.274","soil fauna, temperature, and moisture status all change with",1,2
"1.275","the seasons as well as with more extended periods of time.",1,2
"1.276","Soil must be viewed from both the short-term and long-term",1,2
"1.277","perspective.",1,2
"1.278","Buried Soils",1,2
"1.279","A buried soil is a sequence of genetic horizons in a pedon",1,2
"1.280","that is covered with a surface mantle of new soil material",1,2
"1.281","(defined below) that is 50 cm or more thick, a plaggen epipedon",1,2
"1.282","(defined in chapter 3), or a layer of human-transported material",1,2
"1.283","(defined in chapter 3) that is 50 cm or more thick. The rules for",1,2
"1.284","the taxonomic classification of pedons that include a buried soil",1,2
"1.285","are given in chapter 4.",1,2
"1.286","Surface Mantle of New Soil Material",1,2
"1.287","A surface mantle of new soil material is a layer of naturally",1,2
"1.288","deposited mineral material that is largely unaltered, at least",1,2
"1.289","in the lower part. It may have a diagnostic surface horizon",1,2
"1.290","(epipedon) and/or a cambic horizon, but it has no other",1,2
"1.291","diagnostic subsurface horizons, all defined in chapter 3.",1,2
"1.292","However, there remains a layer 7.5 cm or more thick that",1,2
"1.293","fails the requirements for all diagnostic horizons, as defined",1,2
"1.294","later, overlying a genetic horizon sequence that can be clearly",1,2
"1.295","identified as a buried soil in at least half of each pedon. The",1,2
"1.296","recognition of a surface mantle should not be based only on",1,2
"1.297","studies of associated soils. A surface mantle of new soil material",1,2
"1.298","that does not have the required thickness specified for buried",1,2
"1.299","soils can be used to establish a phase of a soil series, or even",1,2

"2.315","Soil taxonomy differentiates between mineral soils and",2,3
"2.316","organic soils. To do this, first, it is necessary to distinguish",2,3
"2.317","mineral soil material from organic soil material. Second, it",2,3

"2.363","in writing definitions of taxa, a distinction between what is",2,3
"2.364","meant by a mineral soil and an organic soil is useful. To apply",2,3
"2.365","the definitions of many taxa, one must first decide whether the",2,3
"2.366","soil is mineral or organic. An exception is the Andisols (defined",2,3
"2.367","later). These generally are considered to consist of mineral",2,3
"2.368","soils, but some may be organic if they meet other criteria for",2,3
"2.369","Andisols. Those that exceed the organic carbon limit defined",2,3
"2.370","for mineral soils have a colloidal fraction dominated by short-",2,3
"2.371","range-order minerals or aluminum-humus complexes. The",2,3
"2.372","mineral fraction in these soils is believed to give more control",2,3
"2.373","to the soil properties than the organic fraction. Therefore, the",2,3
"2.374","soils are included with the Andisols rather than the organic soils",2,3
"2.375","defined later as Histosols and Histels.",2,3
"2.376","If a soil has both organic and mineral horizons, the relative",2,3
"2.377","thickness of the organic and mineral soil materials must be",2,3
"2.378","considered. At some point one must decide that the mineral",2,3
"2.379","horizons are more important. This point is arbitrary and depends",2,3
"2.380","in part on the nature of the materials. A thick layer of Sphagnum",2,3
"2.381","has a very low bulk density and contains less organic matter",2,3
"2.382","than a thinner layer of well-decomposed muck. It is much",2,3
